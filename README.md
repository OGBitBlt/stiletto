# **Stiletto**
## Usage
Stiletto is a collection of bash and python scripts that I have built over time to automate simple penetration testing tasks.
The scripts require the bash shell, so on win32 platforms you will need to install WSL (windows subsystem for linux) before running any of the scripts.
You can download the scripts from GitHub, and place them along your path, then from a bash shell type...
```
stilletto.sh
```
...and you will see from fairly user friendly menus which will guide you from there.
